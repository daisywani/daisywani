### Hello, My name is Daisy Wanirwoth ðŸ‘‹ :wave:

I am a data analyst from Finland. I am currently doing a few personal studies at [Datacamp] (https://www.datacamp.com/community/open-courses/) as a way of improving on my data analysis skills. I am passionate about python, nupy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, statsmodels and seaborn.
