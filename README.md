### Hello, My name is Daisy Wanirwoth ðŸ‘‹ :wave:

I am a data analyst from Finland. I am currently doing a few personal studies at Datacamp (https://www.datacamp.com/community/open-courses/) as a way of improving on my data analysis skills. I am passionate about python, numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, statsmodels and seaborn.

I'm currently working on improving programming skills in Python. I started this journey 01-01-2020 and it has been 9 months of constant growth and improvement. I am currently learning Data Analysis workflow at Aalto University (https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/data-analysis/). This is showing me how to present my work for data analysis, the libraries to be used and the practical application of data analysis in real life situations.

I will also be learning Matlab and cloud computing as this is also important for me to be able to deliver good work as a data analyst.

I am looking for internship or entry level job opportunities to further develop my skills. Changing my career path to data analysis has been one of the best decisions i have ever made and i intend on taking my new found skills to the next level with a masters degree.
